The Tic Tac Toe classic right in your terminal.   

I considered it to be a cool idea for a project in my process of learning Rust as a beginner. 

In the future, I will definitely recreate and enhance this project when I am more proficient in the language, perhaps by implementing functionalities such as
  - a cursor in the terminal (so you don't have to type your move)
  - the option to play with another person on your network

The binary is built using:
$ cargo build
and it's run via:
$ cargo run

Note that there should be a field.txt in your working directory. Simply run the code from src.
